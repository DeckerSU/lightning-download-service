    <h1>Lightning Download Service</h1>
    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div class="intro">
      <p>All files are <strong>free</strong>. You are paying only a small fee for file storage and serving services.</p>
      <p>All payments at this stage can be made only with <strong>Lightning Satoshis</strong>.</p>
      <p>The fastest way to start using Lightning is by installing the <a href="https://muun.com/" target="_blank">Muun Wallet</a> and topping it up with some Satoshis on-chain or off-chain (e.g., via BTC).</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> After you create the invoice, <em>do not close</em> the page or invoice window until the payment is settled. You will receive the download link right after your payment is completed.</p>
      <p>Download is allowed only once. After pressing the download button, you will be able to save the file <em>once</em>. If you miss this opportunity (e.g., close the window or something else happens), you will need to create a new invoice and pay again.</p>
